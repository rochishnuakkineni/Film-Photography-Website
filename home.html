      <center><div>From its longstanding history immortalizing memories through pictures, strong film photography often holds a special place 
      in our hearts. From its commonly associated nostalgia and high appeal, let’s go over the brief history of this art form’s history, processing, 
      and why it’s still used in the face of a growing digital photography era. Keep in mind however, it’s the artist and not the tools that make a piece flourish. 
      That being said, in the hands of a strong photographer, they can make photography through the medium of film a visual experience that takes advantages of its strengths like no other.
