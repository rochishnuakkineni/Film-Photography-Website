      <center><div>Film photography is the 2nd in 3 eras of photography technology so far (PetaPixel). 
      It’s after the original plate era (where the first photograph by Louis Daguerre was taken on January 7, 1893) and before the still growing digital era of photography today (started in the mid 1970s by Kodak scientists) (PetaPixel).

	  				<strong><h2 style = "text-align: left">1884</h2></strong>
	  				<p style = "text-align: left">The Film era started in Rochester, New York, 1884 by dry plate manufacturer George Eastman and camera inventor William Hall Walker, who together invented the tools and procedures for a photographic film coated onto malleable material (PetaPixel and PBS). Eastman sold the film roll adapter intended for cameras at the time but struggled to make sales because of the separate equipment needed to shoot the rolls and how the film itself was "harder to process than the glass plate photography technology at the time" (PetaPixel).

	  			<strong><h2 style = "text-align: right">1888</h2></strong>
	  			<p style = "text-align: right"> To combat this, the pair made the “Kodak”, the first film roll camera and preloaded it with enough film for 100 photos (PetaPixel). Customers who purchased the camera would then mail it back to Eastman’s Kodak company to have their cameras reloaded, photos processed and printed (PetaPixel). The reloaded camera and prints would then be mailed back to customers. The camera costed $25 (~$750 today) while developing, printing and reloading was around $10 (~$300 today) (PetaPixel).

	  			<p style = "text-align: left">More experiments to produce functioning forms of color film were further in production by companies like Technicolor in 1914 (Deguzman, 2021). However In 1932, after years of work they were successful in establishing color film techniques from their expensive dye transferring process using 3 color film strips of green, red and blue. Some famous movies using the basis of these techniques include 1939’s The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind (Deguzman, 2021).</p>
